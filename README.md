### UI/UX Design

The design of Nimbux was inspired by several existing weather web applications. I aimed to combine features from various apps to create a seamless and intuitive user experience. The goal was to provide a clean, easy-to-navigate interface while ensuring that all key weather information is accessible at a glance.

The logo was created by a friend, who is a UX designer. She also provided the icons used throughout the app, converting them into vector format to ensure crisp, high-quality visuals. Additionally, we worked together to refine the logo, and finalize the color palette, which reflects both the app's friendly and professional character.
